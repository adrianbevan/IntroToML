# GRADnet-ML
GRADnet Machine Learning Tutorial repository: January 2020
===========================================================
This github repository contains code for the GRADnet Machine Learning Tutorial.  These examples allow you to explore
different algorithms including:
  Decision Trees
  Random Forests
  Neural Networks

Please see the following web page for the GRADnet ML meeting:
  
   http://www.sepnet.ac.uk/sepnet-graduate-network/training-events-201920/machine-learning-and-ai-workshop-15-16-january-2020/
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started:
----------------
Clone the repository with the following command to get started with working with these examples. git clone --branch master https://github.com/adrianbevan/ATLAS-UK-ML.git

The examples pertaining to a given algorithm can be found in the different directories:

  BDT - decision trees using SciKitLearn

  NN  - Neural Networks using TensorFlow

Software Requirements:

The Python environment that these tutorials has been tested on is packaged in the Anaconda framework: https://www.anaconda.com

Install Anaconda and then obtain the following packages:  
    * scikit-plot (`conda install -c conda-forge scikit-plot` OR `pip install scikit-plot`)  
    * opencv (`conda install -c conda-forge opencv` OR `pip install opencv-python`)  
    * keras (`conda install -c conda-forge keras` OR `pip install keras`)  
    * tensorflow (`conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow` OR `pip install tensorflow`)   

If you run into any `ModuleNotFound` errors and cannot work out which packages you are missing please call over someone to help you.
